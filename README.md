# ferry-schedulfor

This repository will contain an open data set with select ferry schedules.
The data is collected and updated by volunteers and is neither official
nor necessarily accurate. It most certainly isnâ€™t complete. Rather, we are
at a very early, highly experimental state.

All data can be found in the various files in the `data` directory. The data
format is inspired by the [GTFS Schedule](https://gtfs.org/schedule/)
specification. The data model should be compatible but we are using a
subset of the [YAML](https://yaml.org/) markup language for easier manual
editing. Consequently, we are calling our format HTFS for Human-editable
Transit Feed Specification. More information can be found in the `doc` directory.
